## Goals
> Outline what you wanna make. It will be composed of smaller items that you can test individually.

#### __Your first goal__
A description of the thing you wish to create and how it will work. This could include a UML diagram (more on that [here][uml]). This should be your over-arching idea.

#### __Your second goal__
 A description of the next goal. This (and subsequent goals) is usually created through a process or iteration. Start with your main idea. Then as you try and tackle it, you will inevitably see a necessity to break the main goal down into smaller parts. Each of these is another goal to go here.
 
#### __And so forth__
You get the idea...

## Research
> These are the resources you found useful. This is also where you can put any useful reference material. Data sheets are an obvious inclusion here, but you should include anything that would be helpful to another person new to the project. Each reference should have a reasonably short explanation of why it was helpful or what it was used for.


*  A [reference manual][ref] that is pertinent.
[ref]:http://beagleboard.org/static/beaglebone/latest/Docs/Hardware/BONE_SRM.pdf
*  A [handy tool](https://stackedit.io/) that you found helpful.
*  Even source code:

```js
console.log("A sample piece of code");
preferably = [	
	"something short that you wanted in the documentation",
	 "or maybe something that you wanted to emulate",
];
```

*  A [website](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) that helped you understand something.
 
*  A helpful image.

## Results
> Reference which goal this was work towards. Put down any results here, any measurements you took, things you did, problems you ran into, odd behaviors you noticed, etc. Generally just an objective commentary on how you achieved each goal. 

#### __Your first goal__
* I couldn't get it to work, so I added a smaller goal.
* After verifying my sub-component, I retested and got a new result. This result is better, but not what I wanted. I'm going to add another goal. 
* After identifying the problem in *that* I was able to get the right result. 
* Re-testing proves that the design is functional.


#### __Your second goal__
* I tested *this* and got *this* result. This result isn't what I was expecting. I'm going to try something else.
* I tested *this* and got *that* result. This result **is** what I was expecting, and verifies my design.

#### __And so forth__
* I tested *this* and got *that* result. This result isn't what I was expecting, but I think I know what the problem is. 
* I tested *this* and identified that that **was** the problem.
